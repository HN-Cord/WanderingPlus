# WanderingPlus

**WanderingPlus** is an enhancement plugin for Minecraftâ€™s Wandering Trader, designed to improve gameplay balance and provide more flexibility for both players and server administrators.

## âœ¨ Why WanderingPlus?

In vanilla Minecraft, the Wandering Trader is global â€” only one trader can exist at a time, often spawning in inconvenient or unsafe places.  
This plugin reworks the system to make the Wandering Trader **more player-focused, balanced, and manageable**, while still respecting vanilla mechanics.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Per-player Traders**  
  Each player can have their own Wandering Trader, instead of being limited to just one per server.

- **Faithful Vanilla Logic**  
  Preserves vanilla spawn conditions, including location checks, safety rules, and random spawn chances.

- **Improved Spawn Mechanics**
    - Safer spawning (no half slabs, no dangerous spots).
    - Adjustable spawn chance (default max 25% for increased rarity).
    - Trader limits based on active players (`online players / 2`).
    - Smarter despawn/reset system, prioritizing the earliest despawned player.
    - Independent spawn chance calculation per player.
